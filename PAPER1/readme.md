INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION:


   This paper is all about software its constituents and emprical and descriptive study of software artifacts.
In this paper it is described that it is 2020 and still there is no any standard defination of software.
Every one is giving different definations. None of literature , standard contracts and industrial contracts has given consistent defination 
nor practical defination of software.

A system with a source code without a complete build specification and built executables is unusable. Therefore build code  as well as built executables should be considered as constituents of software.

The common defination that is given in oxford dictionary of English is not helpfull that is : 

   "Software are the programs and other operating information used by a computer."

The motivation of this paper is that it is neccesary to understand actually ehat the software is and what are its artifacts OR 
what are the constituents of software.


RESEARCH:


    Research From Standards:

Software engineering standards agree that :

  "Software consists of artifacts that are programs,documentation,databases,fonts etc.
And the software also disagree on the artifacts that consititute software like graphics and databasese.


Computer programs,procedures,rules and documentation of an information of processing system. It's important to include both executeable
and non-executable software.

Non-executable software controls or supports the executable software and executable software manages digital information.


    Research From Contracts:

Contracts define software as :

  "Software is a customer-specified software that includes interfaces".

  Customer specified software is the software that is not classified as standard software.

    Research From Academics:

Academics define software as:
 
  "Software is more than just computer programs but is also associated with documentation,data and configuration.It may include system documentation, user documentation and websites for users to download recent product information."

   From Emprical Study:

    "Software is the collection of any of  the 19 artifacts types that humans collect and store. And these artifacts are more than just code, documentation is an integral part of them,depending on the domain data is not necessary, and even through rare code is not strictly necessary."

Artifacts are :

  Sorce code , specific source code , script code , binary code , build code , insfrastucture code , image , video , music , configuration , database , font , archeive , markup , document , app data and other.

There are more than 13 million artifacts stored in 23715 software repositries at GITHUB.

RESULTS:

  From all above studies and researchs it is confrimed that software is more than code. More than 90% of repositries contains code , data and documentation.

There 1670 repositries (7%) that don't contain data.

Documentation is omni-present in software.

From this study we confirm that software is usually more than just code.

The frequencies and ratios between code to data and data to documentation are wekly corelated. Since the bigger the software, more it contains code than data and more data than documentation.

Since from all above studies software is defined as:


     "Software is the collection of any of  the 19 artifacts types(artifacts defined in emprical study) that humans collect and store. And these artifacts are more than just code, documentation is an integral part of them,depending on the domain data is not necessary, and even through rare code is not strictly necessary."
